# Leap_Motion_Games
A project I worked on while studying Computer Science at Duale Hochschule Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. The goal was to create two games using the Leap Motion Hand Recognition Device and compare them by conducting a test study. Both games are using Gamification and Serious Games Design Principles.
